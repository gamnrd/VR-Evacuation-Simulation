# VR-Evacuation-Simulation


About

The Cambridge Memorial Hospital: Evacuation Training project is a simulation of hazardous scenarios in which users can experience and train on what to do when emergency occurs at a hospital.


Goals

This product should train and educate people on the procedures of how to evacuate patients and control the situation at hand. We do this by providing a virtual situation in which staff or related individuals take the perspective of a hospital staff member in charge of patients and assign them things to do when an emergency occurs.


Features

Virtual Scenarios – The simulation provides users with custom scenarios.

Immersive Environment – The simulation provides a stylish and relatable 3D environment which is explored by the user.

Interactive Objects – The simulation provides users with the ability to examine tasks and interact with tools to aid them.

Tracking and Analytics – The simulation tracks a user’s progress through the tasks and at the end grades them on their performance.
